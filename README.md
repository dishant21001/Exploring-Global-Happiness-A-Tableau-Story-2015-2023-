# Exploring-Global-Happiness-A-Tableau-Story-2015-2023

Project Overview

Understanding happiness is essential to improving well-being worldwide. This project leverages Tableau Public to analyze data from the World Happiness Report (2015-2023), covering 150+ countries. The goal is to identify key drivers of happiness and visualize how factors like GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom, and generosity influence well-being globally.

Dataset & Methodology

The dataset was sourced from the World Happiness Report, a public dataset from Kaggle. It contains yearly reports from 2015 to 2023, measuring happiness scores based on factors such as:

  ‚Ä¢	GDP per capita: Economic prosperity
  
  ‚Ä¢	Social support: The presence of close relationships and support networks
  
  ‚Ä¢	Healthy life expectancy: Longevity and quality of life
  
  ‚Ä¢	Freedom to make life choices: Personal autonomy
  
  ‚Ä¢	Generosity: Willingness to give and help others
  
  ‚Ä¢	Perception of corruption: Trust in institutions

For analysis, I used Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards that help explore trends, correlations, and regional comparisons.

Key Visualizations & Insights

1. Happiness Status Overview (2015-2023)

  ‚Ä¢	Regional Happiness Trends: A highlighted table showcasing average happiness scores by region, allowing users to compare overall well-being across continents.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Top 10 Happiest & Least Happy Countries: Interactive maps displaying the most and least happy countries using color-coded indicators. Tooltips reveal country details, region, and average happiness scores.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Dashboard Integration: These visualizations are combined into a single dashboard titled ‚ÄúHappiness Status Overview‚Äù, which allows users to filter and interact with the data seamlessly.

2. Effect of GDP per Capita on Happiness Score

  ‚Ä¢	GDP & Happiness Trends: A multiline chart visualizing the top 10 happiest countries' GDP trends over the years.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Happiness Score vs. GDP Per Capita: A line chart showing how GDP and happiness correlate from 2015-2023.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Dashboard for Economic Impact: These charts are compiled into a dashboard that allows users to explore the economic influences on happiness.

3. Social & Well-Being Factors Impacting Happiness

  ‚Ä¢	Freedom & Social Support: A dual combination bar and line chart illustrating the role of freedom and social support in happiness levels.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Generosity & Healthy Life Expectancy: Another dual-axis chart displaying how generosity and life expectancy contribute to well-being.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Dashboard for Social Factors: This section features an interactive dashboard that highlights the most influential non-economic happiness drivers.

4. Happiness Trends in the Least Happy Countries

  ‚Ä¢	A similar analysis was conducted for the least happy countries, focusing on their economic, social, and well-being factors.
  
  ‚Ä¢	Key differences: Many of these nations struggle with low GDP, weak social structures, and high corruption perceptions, leading to persistently lower happiness scores.

Key Takeaways

üìå Economic prosperity plays a role in happiness, but social and health factors have a stronger impact. üìå Countries with high levels of social support, freedom, and low corruption tend to be the happiest. üìå The happiness gap remains significant between the happiest and least happy nations, highlighting disparities in quality of life.

This project allowed me to apply data visualization, analytics, and storytelling skills to uncover meaningful insights from a decade of global happiness data. I plan to expand this project by exploring machine learning models to predict future happiness trends based on historical data.
